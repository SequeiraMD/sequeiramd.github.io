					<div id="hidden3" class="collapse">
						<p>A series of forest fires in Central Portugal in 2017 were responsible for a wide vegetation clearance 
						leaving the weathering profiles more exposed to erosive action. Suspended loads from catchment areas affected 
						by these fires were periodically sampled to evaluate spatial and seasonal variability in sediment production.</p>
						<p>Bulk mineralogy reflected the geology of the source areas, but displayed high variability even for a single 
						sampling site, which can be partially linked to the grain-size control on sediment composition.
						Clay mineralogy provided a better picture of the denudation at catchment scale. The predominance of detrital 
						illite with low I5/I10, indicated very shallow weathering profiles. Chlorite was usually the second most 
						common mineral, whilst kaolinite was detected only in less steep catchment areas with a predominance of 
						granitic basement rocks or where previous-cycle depositional units are also present. Year-long shifts in clay 
						assemblages were attributed to different spatial patterns of denudation.</p>

				<p><b>2019.11.21: <a href="#hidden1" data-toggle="collapse">Assessment of superficial water quality of small catchment basins affected by portuguese rural fires of 2017</a></b></p>
					<div id="hidden1" class="collapse">
						<p>An article reflecting some of the findings of a study of surface water quality after intense forest fires 
						was published on the Ecological Indicators Journal.</p>
						<p>The article reflects the findings done on the first 8 months after the forest fires that affected Portugal 
						on October of 2017, in relation with the surface water quality. After the 8 months of an almost monthly monitoring 
						campaign, with focus on the water physical and chemical parameters, as well as a few compounds, it was noticed a 
						considerable increase of turbidity, aluminium, iron and manganese. An increase in arsenic was also found on a smaller 
						basin, however, it wasn’t possible to establish if the increase of this element was related to the forest fires, or 
						the agricultural use of the basin. These changes were more obvious in the intense 
						raining months of March and April. Interestingly, after this period, most of water parameters returned to normal 
						levels, suggesting that precipitation must have played an important role as a depuration system.</p>
						<p>These findings suggest that after a change of forest and natural areas to burnt areas, surface water should be 
						the monitored for nitrate, aluminium, iron and manganese as to address what potential treatment the water should 
						undergo prior to its usage.</p>
