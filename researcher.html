					<div id="hidden14" class="collapse">
						<p>Em outubro de 2017, a região Centro de Portugal foi fortemente afetada por vários incêndios florestais. A bacia hidrográfica do Mondego foi afetada em quase 
						30% da sua extensão. Para compreender os impactes destes incêndios na qualidade das águas superficiais, foram realizadas campanhas de monitorização em dois anos
						hidrológicos. Em 10 pontos de monitorização foram analisados os parâmetros físico-químicos das águas superficiais. Usando dados de parâmetros físico-químicos 
						dos últimos 30 anos foram criados fundos geoquímicos e determinados os impactes que os incêndios tiveram sobre as águas superficiais.
						Imediatamente após os incêndios florestais verificou-se um aumento muito superior ao fundo geoquímico dos teores de Cl, NO3, SO4, Al, As, Fe e Mn. O aumento de Cl, NO3, SO4, e 
						Mn parece estar relacionado com a combustão de matéria orgânica. As altas concentrações de Al e Fe e um aumento da turbidez a par de uma baixa condutividade elétrica, nas campanhas
						de períodos com maior precipitação, sugerem que estes elementos possam estar relacionados com o transporte de sedimentos para as linhas de águas após a remoção da vegetação. No 
						segundo ano hidrológico a maior parte das linhas de água regressaram aos valores normais por comparação ao do seu fundo geoquímico. No entanto, nas linhas de água em bacias 
						localizadas em grandes áreas agrícolas verificaram-se concentrações acima dos fundos geoquímicos para NO3 e As, sugerindo que possam estar parcialmente associados às atividades agrícolas.

					<div id="hidden13" class="collapse">
						<p>In October 2017, the Mondego hydrological basin was devastated by multiple wildfires. To understand the impacts that these had on surface water quality, monthly monitoring campaigns were implemented in the affected catchments. The campaigns oversaw the water’s physical characteristics and major, minor and trace constituents. Analysis of major changes was performed, as well as comparisons with geochemical backgrounds, determined using publicly available data collected prior to the fires. The backgrounds allowed us to verify which water parameters were most influenced by the fires. Wildfires were responsible for increasing turbidity on all watercourses, and electrical conductivity increased in watercourses with flatter, granitoid/sedimentary-dominated watersheds. Cl−, NO3−, and SO42− surpassed background values in most monitored basins. Changes in Al, Fe, Mn, As, Ba, and Zn concentrations were observed in all watercourses after the wildfires and decreases after intense rainfall. Background values were particularly exceeded for Al in all monitoring points and As in basins with extensive agricultural areas. Burnt plant material and organic matter partially account for the increases in Cl−, NO3−, SO42−, Al, As, Fe, and Mn content. High Al, Fe and Zn with low water conductivity suggests that these elements were associated with sediment loads after the removal of vegetation.

						<p>Following the major wildfires that affected the Central region of Portugal in 2017, a watercourse monitoring campaign was initiated in November 2017 to determine changes in water proprieties in a post-fire scenario, and establish the persistence of these effects. In the Mondego River basin, 10 points, from 6 watercourses, were chosen based on the size of the watershed and the percentage of burnt area. Monthly water monitorization featured in situ parameters and major ions analysis. A higher electrical conductivity was found in water in November 2017, before the first runoffs. Major ions have, in generally, decreased from December to January. However, the Cavalos brook showed an increase in NO3 concentration, and the downstream of Mondego River showing increase in Ca, HCO3 and NO3.

					<div id="hidden11" class="collapse">
						<p>The wildfires of 2017 were responsible for vegetation clearance in a wide area of central Portugal, 
						leaving the weathering profiles more exposed to erosive action. In the present research, suspended loads 
						from a set of catchment areas affected by these fires with diverse geological and orographic features 
						were periodically sampled to evaluate spatial and seasonal variability in sediment production. Bulk 
						mineralogy reflected the geology of the source areas, but displayed high variability even for a single 
						sampling site, which can be partially linked to the grain-size control on sediment composition. 
						Clay mineralogy provided a better picture of the denudation at catchment scale. The predominance 
						of detrital illite with low I5/I10 (ratio of the intensities at 5 Å (002) and 10 Å (001)) indicated 
						very shallow weathering profiles. Chlorite was usually the second most common mineral, more common 
						in metasedimentary-derived sediments, whilst kaolinite was detected only in less steep catchment 
						areas with a predominance of granitic basement rocks or where previous-cycle depositional units 
						are also present. Year-long shifts in clay assemblages were attributed to different spatial 
						patterns of denudation. A depletion of kaolinite occurred in sampling sites mainly sourced by 
						granitoids. An opposite trend was observed where areas with Meso-Cenozoic deposits, less affected 
						by the wildfires than those with basement units, occupy significant proportions of the drainage 
						basins. This trend was ascribed to the wearing out of the weathering profiles covering the basement. 
						Regolith denudation was also testified by a progressive decrease in I5/I10. Shifts in clay mineralogy 
						linked with progressive surface denudation were found to be limited in areas with shallow soils, 
						but may complicate any paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on sediment composition when more 
						evolved weathering profiles have been eroded.

						<p>In October of 2017 a series of rural fires affected Portugal’s Central Region, leading to the destruction 
						of 40–60% of the forest area in some districts. A monitoring program was initiated in 5 catchments of the
						Mondego drainage basin, in order to understand the temporal evolution of the water’s physical and chemical 
						characteristics in a post-fire scenario. This monitoring program was implemented in catchments with sizes 
						between 20 km2 and 160 km2 in areas 60%–99% burnt. For each catchment a gauging point was selected near the 
						mouth of the river. These 5 gauging points were assessed monthly, starting one month after the fire, in 
						November 2017, and ending in June 2018. In each campaign stream water was sampled for laboratory analysis 
						and in-situ physical-chemical proprieties were measured. Major ions in water samples were determined through 
						ion chromatography (IC) and molecular absorption spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission
						spectrometry (ICP-OES). Trace elements were evaluated through ICP-OES and inductively coupled plasma mass 
						spectrometry. Total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon were evaluated through the oxidation method
						and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The data 
						collected was crossed with the catchment’s morphometric, geological and land use data, including characteristics
						of the burnt area. Results showed that these fires affected the surface waters in the studied catchments, 
						producing an increase in turbidity, and in the concentrations of Al, Fe, Mn and possibly NO3 and As.

					<div id="hidden5" class="collapse">
						<p>The Portuguese Central Region was affected, in 2017, by major series of wildfires that contributed 
						to the largest burnet area of the last 10 years. After a wildfire, the loss of vegetation might lead 
						directly to soil erosion and subsequently contamination of superficial water. The reduction, or elimination,
						of the vegetative cover diminishes evapotranspiration and rain drop’s interception, exposing soil 
						and increasing run-off, which associated with a decreased rugosity, due to the loss of organic matter 
						and soil debris, increases its erodibility. During the combustion phase, condensation of volatile 
						organic compounds in sublayers of the soil might lead to a hydrophobic soil. With the first rains it 
						is expected an increase in run-off which introduces sediments, ashes and other debris in the watercourses, 
						leading to an increase in turbidity, and diminished dissolved oxygen. Ashes transported by the 
						run-off carry nitrates and phosphates leading to an increased content of algae and water eutrophication. 
						The combustion of bioaccumulating species could lead to elevated concentrations of metals and 
						metalloids, dangerous for their toxicity and persistence. During a wildfire, polycyclic aromatic 
						hydrocarbon (PAH) could be formed, despite their insoluble nature, these can be found on soil or 
						watershed sediments, and pose a major concern due to their cancerogenic effects. To compare water 
						proprieties before and after the first run-offs and the water quality in subsequently months, 
						understanding what are the effects of the run-off in a post-fire scenario, and, if any, determine 
						the persistence of these same effects, a watercourse monitoring campaign was initiated in November 
						of 2017 in the Mondego River basin, which was affected with approximately 30% of burnt area. 
						For this, 10 monitoring points, from 6 watercourses, were chosen based on the size of the watershed 
						and the percentage of burnt area. The monthly water monitorization feature in situ analysis and 
						laboratory analysis of major anions, major and metallic cations, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), 
						Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and PAHs. Due to their close relation between suspended sediments 
						and water characteristics and composition, a mineralogical analysis for these was also considered, 
						as well as a chemical and granulometric analysis in some cases. Bottom sediments are collected in 
						the beginning and the end of the major pluviosity period, and submitted to a granulometry and 
						mineralogic analysis, to perceive changes in erosion and transport of watercourses. Data obtained 
						so far shown a higher electric conductivity in the November, which could be associated with ashes 
						presence in the water, before the first run-offs, with a decreasing trend in the next months. This
						is also supported in the lower pH values, in December, and a return to values similar to November, 
						in January. Most of the monitoring points have shown a decrease in concentration of Cl, Na, K, Mg, 
						Ca and SO4 from December to January, which might be related to a high mineralized run-off. Also, 
						the majority of the waters of the monitoring points changed their hydrochemical facies, for the 
						same time period, with a decrease in their chlorinate content.

					<div id="hidden4" class="collapse">
						<p>Age determination and the petrogenesis of the granitic rocks of Portugal, especially of the 
						north and center, have been subjects of research and debate by groups of geologists, mainly in the 
						last decades of the 20th century. First, they were considered as a single intrusion, which was 
						reflected in the geological maps of Portugal, where all the granitoids were represented by the 
						same symbol. Reflecting the advances in the methods of radiometric dating and in the geological 
						knowledge, it is recognized today a range of ages to the granitoid rocks of northern and central 
						Portugal going from the Neoproterozoic to the late Paleozoic times. As examples of these studies,
						we considered the granitic and gneissic rocks outcrop in the center of Portugal, in the region between 
						Coimbra and Nisa, in the vicinity of two firstorder tectonic accidents: the Porto-Tomar-Ferreira do 
						Alentejo shear zone (ZCPTFA) and the Tomar-Badajoz-Cordoba shear zone (ZCTBC). These structures 
						represent a border between two geotectonic zones of the Iberian Massif: the Central Iberian Zone 
						(ZCI) and the Ossa Morena Zone (ZOM). The aim of this study was to sketch the evolution of the 
						representation of these granitic and gneissic bodies in the geological maps of Portugal, scales 
						1:500.000 and 1:1.000.000, from the nineteenth century to the present day, and compare this representation 
						with the advances of geological knowledge. Granites and gneisses, in the geological maps at 1:1.000.000 
						scale, are included in large groups and it is not possible to distinguish the different bodies in respect
						to its nature and age, with only some differentiation for the gneisses represented in the 2010 edition. 
						This distinction is achieved in the geological maps at 1:500.000 scale, especially, in the 1972 and 1992
						editions. The evolution of the cartographic representation and maps legends reflect the advancement in 
						the application of K-Ar and Rb-Sr radiometric methods of dating, in the eighties and nineties of the 
						20th century, and U-Pb dating in early years of the 21st century. It also points out the advances in 
						petrography and geochemistry, which are also crucial to the edition of numerous geological maps of 
						Portugal, at a scale of 1:50.000. According to the available data, these rocks represent evidence of
						magmatism during Neoproterozoic and Cambric-Ordovician times. It is concluded that there are significant

					<div id="hidden1" class="collapse">
						<p>The old Escádia Grande gold mine, located in the Góis region, was exploited during the roman 
						occupation in the Iberian Peninsula, and again between 1939 and 1952, having been abandoned ever since. 
						The area is predominantly constituted by the “Complexo Xisto Grauvaquico” (CXG), consisting of phyllites 
						and metagraywackes, with intrusions of stockwork type veins that where explored. The mine has four entrances
						to the galleries that are sealed, with drains at the bottom that pour mining drainage, as well as two 
						tailing occupying a total area of 25,000 m2, which are a mixed of the sterile material and the discarded
						materials from the process of ore treatment. The presented study describes and evaluates the environmental
						changes that have been generated by the mining activity and its abandonment in terms of water, stream 
						sediments and soils. The waters that travel through the mining area show a contamination that extends up
						to 1.5 km South, with high levels of As, Cu, Pb and SO4, associated with a decrease in pH and an increase 
						in electrical conductivity. Due to the low pH values, and high concentrations of arsenic and nickel, the 
						water becomes unfit for human consumption, being, however, acceptable for irrigation. The stream sediments
						are under the direct influence of the mine, presenting high geoaccumulation indexes of Ag, As, Au, Fe, Pb, 
						Sb and Zn, being the highest preoccupation the water line that crosses the mining area, with high 
						geoaccumulation of arsenic, antimony, silver and gold, occurring smaller contaminations of lead, iron and zinc.
						The mining area and mineralized veins area present, generally, acid soils with low electric conductivity. 
						The Southern tailings causes, in the surrounding soils, an increase in concentrations of As, Au, Cu, Mn, Ni,
						Pb, Sb and Zn, being the main focus of soil contamination. The Northern tailings causes an increase of Cu 
						and Ni concentrations in the nearby soils. While the mineralized veins increase the concentrations of Ag, 
						Au and Sb.
